## Project Goals

The goal of LokPass is to create an extensible application that:

- Stores passwords using modern cryptographic standards
- Is modular and flexible in how users interact with it (UI, CLI, API)
- Has an own password generator
- Automatic Backups
- Has portable builds with no installations needed
- Can import from KeePass-Files (.kdbx)

## Frontend

- Desktop UI (Avalonia)

To be defined – possible options include:

- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Web-based or mobile clients (future consideration)
